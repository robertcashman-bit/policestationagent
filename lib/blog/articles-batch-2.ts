## Key takeaways

- **Freelance police station representative vs duty solicitor** is mainly about *how someone is engaged*: rota allocation versus firm instruction.
- Both pathways need clear file notes so clients, billing, and supervision stay coherent.
- Freelance reps often extend a firm’s strategy; duty solicitors may own the file or hand off — practices vary.

## Questions this article answers

- How does duty solicitor allocation differ from instructing a freelance rep?
- When might a firm still book freelance cover if duty exists?
- What should be recorded on the file after attendance?

## Two different front doors

**Duty solicitors** are typically accessed through a rota system when a detainee asks for the duty solicitor or when that pathway is otherwise engaged. The point is **scheme allocation**, not a standing relationship with a particular firm.

**Freelance police station representatives** are usually **instructed by a named criminal defence firm** that already represents the client (or is about to). The firm chooses the representative from its panel or network.

## Who is the client’s “lawyer”?

In both settings, clear communication matters. The detainee should understand **who is giving advice**, whether a solicitor will take over later, and how messages reach the firm that owns the file.

Freelance reps often act as the **eyes and ears** of an instructing fee earner. Duty solicitors may carry the file forward themselves or hand over to another department — practices vary by firm.

## Skill sets overlap — incentives differ

Accredited representatives and solicitors may share custody experience. The difference is often **governance**: who supervises, who holds professional indemnity for which elements, and what the accreditation scheme permits on the day.

Firms should not use freelance cover as a way to dodge supervision obligations. Equally, reps should not accept instructions outside their accreditation or without agreed reporting lines.

## When firms still book a freelance rep

Even where duty solicitor cover exists, firms frequently instruct freelance reps when:

- They need **their own strategy** followed to the letter.
- There is a **relationship** with a trusted rep in that town.
- **Capacity** on the duty rota is uncertain at busy times.
- **Conflict** or brand considerations make an external rota call unattractive.

## Practical takeaway

Write down **which pathway you used** on the file note: duty scheme versus instructed rep, with times and names. That single line prevents confusion at billing and at court later.

- [Duty solicitor context on this site](/DutySolicitorVsRep)

## Directory use

Whether you are a firm or a rep, the [accredited representative directory](/directory) is a neutral place to **match supply and demand** — it does not replace rota rules or professional obligations.

## Key takeaways

- **Mistakes instructing freelance police station reps** usually trace to thin briefs, vague strategy, slow callbacks, and weak feedback loops.
- Fix the handover template, escalation ladder, and billing assumptions before blaming “rep quality.”
- Panel reps are independent professionals — respect boundaries and data rules.

## Questions this article answers

- What briefing errors create the most custody friction?
- How should firms handle mid-attendance decisions and billing?
- What habits protect relationships with freelance representatives?

## 1. The “title-only” brief

These **mistakes instructing freelance police station reps** are easy to avoid once you see them. Sending only an offence label (“GBH — Maidstone”) forces the rep to reconstruct context under pressure. Fix: use the template in [what to include in a brief](/Blog/what-to-include-in-a-police-station-brief).

## 2. Ambiguous strategy

“We’ll play it by ear” is not an instruction. Either delegate clearly with boundaries or nominate someone reachable for a five-minute decision.

## 3. Hiding vulnerabilities

If the client needs an AA or interpreter, **say it early**. Discovering literacy issues ten minutes before interview helps nobody.

## 4. Slow responses mid-custody

Custody moves fast. If nobody picks up the escalation line, the rep is left between bad choices. Use [communication norms](/Blog/why-fast-clear-communication-matters-in-police-station-representation) your night team actually follows.

## 5. Billing surprises

Agree **who pays**, cancellation rules, and mileage assumptions up front. Disputes after the fact burn relationships.

## 6. No feedback loop

If notes were good, say so. If they were late or unclear, say that too. Reps adjust; silence does not teach.

## 7. Treating reps like employees

Panel reps are **independent professionals**. Instructions should respect that — including data protection and supervision boundaries.

## 8. Skipping post-attendance routing

Notes that sit unread in a shared mailbox miss bail dates. Assign someone to **acknowledge and file** the same day.

## Build better panels

Combine this article with [out-of-hours network planning](/Blog/out-of-hours-police-station-cover-for-law-firms) so you are not always calling the same exhausted name at 2 a.m.

## Key takeaways

- **Police station handover notes** should follow the same headings every time: metadata, disclosure, advice summary, outcome, tasks, risks.
- Factual tone beats advocacy in notes; flag questions back to the firm instead of bold predictions.
- Send on approved secure channels and acknowledge receipt on the firm side.

## Questions this article answers

- What structure do fee earners actually read at midnight?
- How much interview detail belongs in a handover?
- How should confidentiality and storage be handled?

## Why structure beats prose

**Police station handover notes** work best when they follow a predictable shape. Fee earners skim at speed. **Headings and bullets** beat long paragraphs. A predictable order means nothing important is missed when someone tired is reading at midnight.

## Suggested layout

### 1. Metadata

- Date and times **in / out**
- Custody suite and officer names if recorded
- Representative name and instructing firm/file ref

### 2. Disclosure summary

What the officer said they would rely on — exhibits, summaries, keys dates. Note **what you did not receive** if that affects advice.

### 3. Client instructions and advice (high level)

Summarise the **interview approach** agreed with the client and any mid-interview changes after further advice. Avoid unnecessary adjectives; stick to what happened.

### 4. Outcome

Charge, NFA, bail, RUI, voluntary rearrangement, or other. Copy **conditions and dates** carefully.

### 5. Immediate actions for the firm

List **who** must do **what** by **when**: obtain medical records, chase CCTV, speak to ID officer, etc.

### 6. Risk flags

Safeguarding, bail risk, media risk, or anything that should sit on the file cover.

## Tone and confidentiality

Send through **secure channels**. If you must phone first, follow with written confirmation. Do not forward custody material to personal email.

## For firms receiving notes

Acknowledge receipt. If the rep missed something, ask once clearly — they usually prefer a direct question to silent disappointment. If you are building a panel, pair note quality with [how firms instruct freelance reps](/Blog/how-firms-can-instruct-freelance-police-station-reps).

## Link to attendance discipline

Pair this habit with the [attendance checklist](/Blog/police-station-attendance-checklist) so field work and reporting stay aligned. Firms can also brief against [what to include in a police station brief](/Blog/what-to-include-in-a-police-station-brief) so reps receive consistent inputs.

## Key takeaways

- **Out of hours police station cover** needs mapped demand, time bands, and geography — not one exhausted contact.
- Vet reps with real test instructions; review note quality and decline rates quarterly.
- Discovery tools complement, but never replace, your formal panel agreement and rota governance.

## Questions this article answers

- How many names should a firm hold per custody cluster?
- How should night escalation and strategy approval work?
- What signals predict reliable freelance cover?

## Map real demand

**Out of hours police station cover** should reflect real demand, not hope. Pull six months of data: **which custody suites**, which nights, and which offence types spike. Your network should match reality, not a map pin in the county town if you never go there.

## Time bands, not vibes

Split **weekday evenings**, **Friday–Saturday**, and **Sunday–bank holiday**. Availability that works for Tuesday teatime may be useless at 3 a.m. Saturday.

## Geography that respects drive time

Add **adjacent county** coverage where forces border each other. A ten-mile trip across a boundary beats a rep stuck on the wrong side of a river crossing at rush hour.

## Vetting beyond the CV

Check **accreditation**, insurance, references from other firms, and note quality from a test instruction if possible. The [good rep criteria article](/Blog/what-makes-a-good-police-station-representative) lists traits that predict reliability.

## Escalation playbooks

Write a one-page **night script**: who answers the phone, who approves strategy changes, who logs the instruction. Reps should not be guessing whether they can wake a partner.

## Quality control without micromanagement

Quarterly review: late arrivals, note quality, polite decline rate. Drop names that erode trust; add names that earn it.

## Directory discovery

PoliceStationRepUK is built to help you **discover names** you might not meet at the local solicitors’ dinner. Start from [search](/search), then bring people into your formal panel process. Cross-check wider [police station cover](/PoliceStationCover) pages when you explain the model to new fee earners.

## For reps wanting more night work

Keep your profile’s **hours and counties** painfully accurate. Firms remember the rep who said “24/7” but did not pick up.
